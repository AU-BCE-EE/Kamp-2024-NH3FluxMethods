## ALFAM2-app
Application of ALFAM2 model to field experiments.
Run `ALFAM2-app/scripts/main.R` in R to run ALFAM2 model using the bLS temporal frequency, and interpolate cumulative emission and flux to the intervals used in the other methods. 
Results are in `ALFAM2-app/output`.

## ALFAM2-var
Quantification of residual variation in the broader ALFAM2 database to estimate the "institutional effect".
ALFAM2 data (with gap filling!) are in `ALFAM2-var/data-emission`.
Run `ALFAM2-var/data-emission/scripts/main.R` to download a new version.
Run `ALFAM2-var/scripts/main.R` to apply the ALFAM2 model to the measurement data and calculate apparent error (residuals).
Results are summarized in `ALFAM2-var/output`.

## scripts-WT
R scripts for processing WT data to calculate measured ammonia emission. 
Data files are too large to include but scripts are still included here for partial reproducibility. 
The script 'main.R' calls all others.
