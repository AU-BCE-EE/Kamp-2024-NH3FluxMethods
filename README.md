# Directory information
## ALFAM2-app
Application of ALFAM2 model to field experiments.
Run `ALFAM2-app/scripts/main.R` in R to run ALFAM2 model using the bLS temporal frequency, and interpolate cumulative emission and flux to the intervals used in the other methods. 
Results are in `ALFAM2-app/output`.

## ALFAM2-data-eGylle
Measurement data downloaded from ALFAM2 database.
R scripts in `scripts` download data, subset, and export to the `ALFAM2-data-eGylle/data` directory.
Run `ALFAM2-data-eGylle/scripts/main.R` to download a new version.

## ALFAM2-app
Application of ALFAM2 model to field trials.
Run `ALFAM2-app/scripts/main.R` to generate predictions.

## rand-eff-models
Random-effects models for measurement error.
Run `rand-eff-models/scripts/main.R` to fit models.

## scripts-WT
R scripts for processing WT data to calculate measured ammonia emission. 
Data files are too large to include but scripts are still included here for partial reproducibility. 
The script 'main.R' calls all others.

## scripts-MatLab
MatLab scripts for plotting all figures. 

## data-MatLab
Data files are too large to include but summary data files are provided here for reproducing figures.
